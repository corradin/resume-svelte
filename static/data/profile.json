	"summary": "When I went to school I struggled with math. I didn't know to prepare for the tests and get a good grade. When I asked my teacher how I could improve, he stated: \"Prepare for the tests by redoing only the exercises that you failed during class\". Since then, my love for solving complex problems increased and I never got a bad grade anymore.  During the start of my professional career, I accumulated knowledge, in the same way, by failing often and improving. I was able to get things done. During this time I was doing full-stack development while my interest in front-end development grew.  Later in my career, I realized that I wanted to be more like my teacher, giving back what I've learned and helping others grow. I do this, by listening to the developers' needs, helping them solve technical challenges in pairing sessions, facilitating knowledge-sharing meetings, improving their developer experience, and developing and hosting technical courses. I believe I'm at my best when I can combine solving technical challenges with helping other developers grow and I'm grateful for each day where I can do both.",
